For this project I have used the Heart Disease dataset from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease. In order to properly credit the producers of the dataset (and for reference purposes) I have included some relevant information from the website.

Please note that this project is for personal study purposes only. If I have incorrectly provided credit or you are the publisher and feel that you want me to change anything, just get in touch.

From the site, I have only used the processed version of the Cleveland Clinic dataset.

Publication Request: 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
This file describes the contents of the heart-disease directory.

This directory contains 4 databases concerning heart disease diagnosis.
All attributes are numeric-valued.  The data was collected from the
four following locations:

1. Cleveland Clinic Foundation (cleveland.data)
2. Hungarian Institute of Cardiology, Budapest (hungarian.data)
3. V.A. Medical Center, Long Beach, CA (long-beach-va.data)
4. University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland (switzerland.data)

Each database has the same instance format.  While the databases have 76 raw attributes, only 14 of them are actually used.  Thus I've taken the liberty of making 2 copies of each database: one with all the attributes and 1 with the 14 attributes actually used in past experiments.

The authors of the databases have requested that any publications resulting from the use of the data include the  names of the principal investigator responsible for the data collection at each institution.  They would be:

1. Hungarian Institute of Cardiology. Budapest: Andras Janosi, M.D.
2. University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland: William Steinbrunn, M.D.
3. University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland: Matthias Pfisterer, M.D.
4. V.A. Medical Center, Long Beach and Cleveland Clinic Foundation: Robert Detrano, M.D., Ph.D.

Thanks in advance for abiding by this request.

Relevant Information:

This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them.  In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to this date.  The "goal" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient.  It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4. Experiments with the Cleveland database have concentrated on simply attempting to distinguish presence (values 1,2,3,4) from absence (value 0).  
   
The names and social security numbers of the patients were recently removed from the database, replaced with dummy values.

One file has been "processed", that one containing the Cleveland database. All four unprocessed files also exist in this directory.
